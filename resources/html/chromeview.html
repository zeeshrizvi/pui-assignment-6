                    <h3>A Google Chrome extension designed to combat the problem of selective expose on Facebook</h3>
                </div>
                <div id="Text"> 

                    <p>This past election cycle was the first time my team (comprised of Ryan Sickles, Min Kim and Benjamin Jang) and I were actively able to engage in politics and we
                    were all very disheartened by the partisanship we witnessed across the country. We witnessed a
                    deep rift emerge between Americans in real-time, and our team was   interested to see how
                    technology played a role in this divide. After we researched the topic, we learned how social media
                    (with facebook in particular) for the sake of catering to their users, creates an ideological bubble that
                    traps the user by feeding them only one point of view. If one is conservative, they will consistently be
                    shown conservative articles and if one is liberal they will only be shown liberal articles. We
                    hypothesised that this involuntary lack of exposure to the other side’s view has been the dominant
                    contributor to the polarization of our society over the past few years. Our goal was to help bridge the
                    gap between viewpoints created by facebook by providing an application that let users see two sides
                    to the same story -- the result was ChromeView</p>

                            <h2>Hypothesis and Initial Mockups</h2>
                            <p>
                                Inspired by Diakopoulos and Kolisa’s ideas, we are hypothesizing that we could start tackling the problem of passive news consumption practices by letting users observe their own behavior on social media and empowering them with tools with which they might interact with news and algorithms in different ways, it would help them become more mindful of their news consumption practices.
                                This informed our two main hypotheses:
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="list">
                                1. We can leverage design to enable everyone to question their versions of reality
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="list">
                                2. If the users are reminded of the fact that they contribute to their own filter bubbles, it will motivate users to be more equally informed of ideologies from both sides of the spectrum.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Based off these hypothesis, we wireframed our application with two primary features. Fig. 1 is our proposed solution to the first hypothesis. It is a prototype of a hover-tool that automatically pops up when a user scrolls on a Facebook news article and provides them with other similar articles from other news sources. This gives users the opportunity to easily explore different views and opinions if they choose to do so. Fig. 2 is a mockup of a “political leaning meter” that solves our second hypothesis. We believe that by showing users a visual representation of their political leanings, we can help them come to the realization that they do not have the “whole picture”, and this cognitive dissonance will motivate them to seek out other points of views.

                            <p>To test our mockups, we conducted a lightweight rapid
                            prototype testing, and we sent out two surverys to gauge interest. This research allowed us to fine tune our concept until we were able to ideate the best feature that users would gain value from.</p>

                            <p>In order to achieve the desired functionality, our team
decided to develop a lightweight, scalable, and easy to use
chrome extension, called ChromeView, that would operate
in the Facebook newsfeed environment. In order to
properly develop this application, the process used was
Agile in nature - through which the application features
were developed, tested, reviewed then iterated on by the
team. The main technology stack for our project was
HTML5, CSS, and JQUERY 3.2. Our project also included
the integration of two API’s: the Lateral.io news
recommender API,
and the Google Chrome Browser API.</p>
