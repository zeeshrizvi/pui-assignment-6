                    <h3>A high fidelity application prototype designed to address problem of bullying in schools</h3>
                </div>
                <div id="Text"> 

                    <p>I was part of a team that was working to create a mobile application based solution for the problem- space of high-school bullying. We did a deep-dive contextual inquiry into the high school experience from several stakeholders and our proposed solution was called Uplift.</p>

                            <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                            <p>Before we began ideating, we conducted primary research by interviewing eight people who, in some way, were stakeholders of our project. They were comprised of 1 administrator, 2 teachers and 5 students. Our research indicated that there was a significant problem with communication and awareness regarding bullying. Students reported not informing an authority figure for one of two reasons: either they just brushed off the incident as merely being ‘teasing’ or something every student experiences, or they were generally uncomfortable with approaching an authority figure. Students explained that the latter reason stems from a fear of repercussions should they report and from not believing they have a close enough relationship with any teacher. They also told us that if they identified a situation as being bullying, they wouldn’t know what steps to take to remedy the situation. We also spoke to two teachers to give us some insight on their behalf. They cited school protocol for how to handle issues related to bullying, and said that if an issue escalates, they report it to administration. Teachers want to foster a better relationship with their students and cultivate a safe and open environment at school.</p>
                            <p>
                            Ultimately, we decided that it was important to help open communication channels between students and teachers/administration. A lack of communication and knowledge about how to handle a situation seemed to be the biggest detriment when attempting to tackle bullying.

                            <p>Through our research, we tried to better understand our stakeholders and the contexts that they operate in. We were able to identify three key stakeholders which included teachers, school administrators and students. We attempted to make general persona’s that captured the needs and wants of each stakeholder as show in Fig 4. As students were our target audience, we attempted to contextualize their experiences by creating a customer journey map to identify and target key pain- points in their experience. This would enable our ideation process when coming up with our application and our solution would be best suited for the user.

                            <h2>High-Fidelity Final Mockup</h2>
                            <p>Our final prototype was a high fidelity mockup created using sketch and proto.io. Our task was to pitch this application to the key stakeholder, who in this case was the school’s administration. The value proposition behind our application was that it helps foster communication between students and their teachers. Unfortunately, every year 3.5 million students are estimated to be bullied in high school’s across the country. What’s worse, over 64% of students do not report when they experience bullying as they feel their voice will not get heard. We believe that Uplift will help solve this problem by making sure every student can feel comfortable voicing their opinion</p>
